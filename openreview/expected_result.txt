# üìù Paper Writing Guidelines for Authors

This guide outlines key principles to help authors avoid common pitfalls and meet the expectations of peer reviewers and the broader research community.

## 1. üìä Comparison to Prior Work

Authors often claim novelty without fair, head-to-head benchmarks against the most relevant baselines.

**Best-Practice Solutions:**

1. **Conduct a Focused Literature Review**

   * Identify 3-5 seminal and recent papers tackling the same problem.
   * Highlight gaps your approach fills.

2. **Re-implement or Use Published Code**

   * Whenever possible, obtain or re-implement baseline methods rather than quoting old results.
   * Match preprocessing, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics exactly.

3. **Present Results in Comparative Tables**

   ```markdown
   | Method        | Dataset     | Metric     | Result         |
   |---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
   | Proposed      | X           | Accuracy   | 87.4 %         |
   | Baseline A    | X           | Accuracy   | 82.1 %         |
   | Baseline B    | X           | Accuracy   | 84.3 %         |
   ```

   * Include confidence intervals or standard errors for each entry.

4. **Discuss Trade-Offs**

   * If your method improves one metric but worsens another (e.g., speed vs. accuracy), analyze why.
   * Be transparent about limitations relative to baselines.
